# Introducing Auriel

We're excited to launch **Auriel** - open-source developer tools for LLM applications and AI agents.

## Why We Built Auriel

AI applications create unique monitoring challenges:

- Inconsistent outputs and hallucinations
- Unpredictable costs
- Complex debugging needs
- Difficult optimization

## AgentLens

Our first tool, [AgentLens](https://github.com/auriel-ai/agentlens), helps you:

- Debug AI interactions offline
- Track and optimize costs
- Identify failure patterns
- Analyze conversation performance

## Beyond Tools

We also build specialized AI agents for specific business needs, like [Propscan](https://propscan.uk/) for property investors.

## Open Source

Our core tools are MIT-licensed because we believe in building in public with community input.
